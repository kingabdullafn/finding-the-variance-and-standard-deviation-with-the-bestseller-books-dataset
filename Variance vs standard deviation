Variance and standard deviation both measure how spread out data is around the mean, but they differ in how they express that spread. Variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean, which means its units are squared and often harder to interpret directly. Standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, which brings the measure back to the original units of the data, making it much easier to understand and use in real-life contexts. In practice, variance is more useful for mathematical and statistical analysis, while standard deviation is preferred for describing and comparing data clearly
